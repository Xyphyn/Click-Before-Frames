# Installation

Install [Geode](https://geode-sdk.org/install/) for Windows, then install this mod from the Geode index.

# What does it do

This mod analyzes your brainwaves to predict when you want to click, before you trigger your input. It is 99% accurate 2% of the time.

# How to use

To edit keybinds, go to the GD options menu and click the "Keys" button in the top right (Mega Hack rebinds won't work).
To enable right click input, you can't.
You must enable the mod for the mod to work.

Disable anything useful when using this mod, because they're pointless.

The mod comes with its own version of code in the code. Be warned that not all lists or leaderboards that allow CAF will consider this legit (lol)!
